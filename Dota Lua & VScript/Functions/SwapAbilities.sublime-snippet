<description>Swaps the slots of the two passed abilities and sets them enabled/disabled: const char* AbilityName1, const char* AbilityName2, ''bool'' bEnable1, ''bool'' bEnable2. The boolean controls which ability is active. The ability order is never swapped when swapping abilities, only the boolean statements are flipped.</description>
